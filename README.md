# Compiler Fuzzing via Guided Value Mutation

## Project description 
as in `/resources/project-topics.pdf`.

> Given a seed program, your target is to find a mutant of this program that causes large binary differences across two compilers. Specifically, your jobs would be 
> - (a) implementing an algorithm that promotes all constant values of a seed program to the input; 
> - (b) designing a fuzzer that mutates a seed program, i.e., how to mutate the constant values; 
> - (c) designing a guidance algorithm for the fuzzer to effectively find mutants that meet our need, i.e., large binary differences.
>
>This project will not require any prior knowledge about compilers, but need a good implementation skills. You can choose any programming languages, python, however, is preferred.

## Solution Architecture


## Proposal
We mutate constant values of a seed program to create valid and runnable, but semantically different, mutants. The
goal is to find large differences in number of assembly instructions produced by two different GCC compiler versions.
We expect that newer compiler versions should not generate significantly more assembly instructions under the same
compiler flags. Faster code not always uses less lines of assembly, see loop unrolling or inlining, but large line differences
can give a hint that at least itâ€™s an interesting case to investigate.
In the course of this project, we will implement a pipeline in Python that parses a seed program and sequentially
generates mutants, compiles them, and compares the generated assembly output. In a first phase, we mutate the constant
values randomly. In a second phase, we mutate the values guided by discrete Bayesian optimisation. We aim to
efficiently find the mutant with the largest difference in assembly instructions, as the compilation time is costly
