# Compiler Fuzzing via Guided Value Mutation

## Project description 
as in `/resources/project-topics.pdf`.

> Given a seed program, your target is to find a mutant of this program that causes large binary differences across two compilers. Specifically, your jobs would be 
> - (a) implementing an algorithm that promotes all constant values of a seed program to the input; 
> - (b) designing a fuzzer that mutates a seed program, i.e., how to mutate the constant values; 
> - (c) designing a guidance algorithm for the fuzzer to effectively find mutants that meet our need, i.e., large binary differences.
>
>This project will not require any prior knowledge about compilers, but need a good implementation skills. You can choose any programming languages, python, however, is preferred.

## Milestones
Slightly rephrased version of guidelines (`/resources/guidelines-for-proposals-reports.pdf`)

### Project Proposal (26.03.)
1-Page project proposal
1. To describe and motivate the problem:
    - What is the Problem?
    - Why is it interesting to solve?
2. To describe the related work:
    - What have other people done?
    - What issues remain, or have not yet been addressed well?
3. To describe your approach:
    - How do you plan to tackle the problem?
    - What is your general approach?
    - Argue why it is feasible and better?
4. To outline a work schedule?
    - When would you like to achieve what?

### Progress Report (30.04.)
1-page report
1. Describe your progress
2. What have you done so far?
3. What remains?
4. What is your plan for the rest of the project?

### Final report (06.06.)
A final report (as a conference-style paper) to describe what we have achieved.
1. Abstract: about 200 word summary of the project
2. Introduction:
    - Describe and motivate the problem
    - High-level overview of the approach
    - Summarized our results
    - Stress what is novel about the work
3. Approach:
    - detailed description of our approach
    - Highlight the main technical difficulties and novelties
4. Implementation and results:
    - if appropriate, describe out implementation and experimental results
    - explain how to interpret the numbers and results if applicable
5. Related work:
    - detailed discussion of related work
    - stress how these efforts relate to our work
    - **avoid** simply listing and describing what other people did
6. Conclusion:
    - summarize the work again
    - discuss limitations and possible future work
7. References: list the papers that we have cited
