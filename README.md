# Compiler Fuzzing via Guided Value Mutation

> Given a seed program, your target is to find a mutant of this program that causes large binary differences across two compilers. Specifically, your jobs would be 
> - (a) implementing an algorithm that promotes all constant values of a seed program to the input; 
> - (b) designing a fuzzer that mutates a seed program, i.e., how to mutate the constant values; 
> - (c) designing a guidance algorithm for the fuzzer to effectively find mutants that meet our need, i.e., large binary differences.
>
>This project will not require any prior knowledge about compilers, but need a good implementation skills. You can choose any programming languages, python, however, is preferred.
